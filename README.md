Jupiter-Broadcasting-Android-App
================================

It is an app to let you view, download and stream shows from http://www.jupiterbroadcasting.com
I developed this as a fork of [Shane's](https://github.com/ShaneQful/Jupiter-Broadcasting-Android-App) app to try out the new shiny Android Studio IDE and all the things in Android development.

### Fetures:

* Live Video and Audio Stream

* Backcatalogue of the shows

* Watch or listen online previous shows

* Download for later

* Has its own player built-in

* Barrier of entry is Gingerbread

* Optimized for ICS+, Holo theme
